# Controls_Technical_Interview

Welcome to Dephy's Controls Technical Interview repo!

If you're reading this then you've made it to the point in the interview process where we want
to know more about you're practical programming and problem solving skills.

In order to submit a solution, clone this repo and create a branch as follows:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DephyInc/Controls_Technical_Interview.git
git checkout -b solution/FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME  # e.g. solution/luke_mooney
```
Once you are ready to submit your solution, create a pull request to _master_.
(Note: You will not have infinite time to submit your solution, but you should have your deadline
info in an email from us)

Depending on which part of the process you're in (you should have this info in an email from us),
you may be working out of the Part_1, Part_2, or Part_3 folders. Look at the readme files in the
applicable folder for more detailed instructions on what to do for each part of the process.

Good Luck!
