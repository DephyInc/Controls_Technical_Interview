# Controls_Technical_Interview

Welcome to Dephy's Controls Technical Interview repo!

If you're reading this then you've made it to the point in the interview process where we want to know more about you're practical programming and problem solving skills.

In order to submit a solution, clone this repo and create a branch as follows:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DephyInc/Controls_Technical_Interview.git
git checkout -b solution/FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME  # e.g. solution/luke_mooney
```
Once you are ready to submit your solution, create a pull request to _master_.
(Note: You will not have infinite time to submit your solution, but you should have your deadline info in an email from us)

Depending on which part of the process you're in and what you're interviewing for (you should have this info in an email from us), you may be working out of the Algorithm_Challenge folder, Debugging_Challenge folder, or both. Look at the readme files in the applicable folder for more detailed instructions on what to do for each part of the process.

## NOTE ABOUT TOOLS YOU WILL NEED:
You will need to install git (for access to the git bash terminal and so you can clone the repo) as well as a GCC compiler.
