If you're reading this then you've made it to the point in the interview process where we want 
to know more about you're practical programming and problem solving skills. 

[INSERT INSTRUCTIONS ON BRANCHING, NAMING, PUSHING, AND TIME CONSTRAINTS]

Depending on which part of the process you're in (you should have this info in an email from us), 
you may be working out of the Part_1, Part_2, or Part_3 folders. Look at the readme files in the 
applicable folder for more detailed instructions on what to do for each part of the process.

Good Luck!
