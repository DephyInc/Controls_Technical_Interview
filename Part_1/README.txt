Exo Controller - Part 1 (10 - 15 minutes)

Your team is designing an ExoBoot controller to augment someone while theyâ€™re walking. 
Given the data from the sensors on the exo, which include a 6-axis IMU located on the calf, 
an encoder located on the ankle, a motor encoder, and a current and voltage reading from 
the motor, the goal is to determine what commands to send to the motor. Hopefully, those 
commands will result in a helpful amount of torque when a user is walking, but will not 
hinder the user in any way when the user is doing other motions. Describe the components 
of the controller you design? What considerations are you making when designing/implementing 
the controller? If you have to split the work among your team, which component could 
you contribute the most to? Which parts would you give to another team member?
