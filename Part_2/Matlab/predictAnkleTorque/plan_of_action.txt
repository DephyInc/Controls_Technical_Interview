BRAINSTORMING
- Predict Torque
	- Use phase variable approach from Goldfarb, use existing data and linear regression to make torque profile
	- Use encoder to detect foot flat and inflection point after foot flat
- Predict Stance
	- Use Jerk along shank axis to predict transitions between stance and swing
	- Use when IMU x acceleration is roughly equal to tangential acceleration from ankle angle
- Predict walking
	- If |accel| is roughly equal to gravity for longer than half a second, assume standing



PLAN FOR TORQUE PREDICTION
1. Create a phase variable from Ankle Angle and either integrated ankle angle
   or angle velocity (will test both to see if they end up being viable) as
   in Goldfarb paper (cite later)
    - Ankle angle did not work for phase variable. Does not monotonically increase. Let's attempt with 
2. perform a polynomial regression on given dataset to create a polynomial 
   function that maps phase variable progression to ankle torque
3. Hard code the values into a predictAnkleTorque function

MODIFIED PLAN OF ACTION
1. Ankle angle did not work for phase variable. Shank angle might, but before we go too crazy, let's knock out an easy one and predict walking

EASY ONE
1. use magnitude acceleration to classify whether user is walking. quick and dirty, not best work but enough to get by in case Torque crashes and burns

REVISED PLAN FOR TORQUE PREDICTION
1. create a kalman filter to predict shank angle (just a rotational kalman filter, use gyro to propagate, accelerometer to correct)
	- turns out just integrating GyroZ does a good enough job for our purposes
2. use shank angle as a phase variable in place of ankle angle
	- this is working
3. see plan A
